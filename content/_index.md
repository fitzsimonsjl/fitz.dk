Here you can find my writing/general ramblings on tech, privacy, and security - with the ocassional personal thing or two thrown in here and there. "Occasional Thoughts" because I've done a crap job of keeping this blog up to date - something I'm planning to remedy in 2026. 

As I spend most of my day job doing mainframe and cloud things, naturally they're going to be the most likely be written about. With that said, the usual disclaimer: all opinions are entirely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.

There's no ability to comment on posts because I don't want to spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here because you liked it/found it useful and want to discuss it further (or simply to send me hate mail),  then send an email to <blog@fitz.dk>. Each post has a "Reply via email" button at the bottom so it's as easy as possible to ensure your insult is delivered promptly based on whatever you just read.

**The main goal of this site is to force myself to write/learn in public** because then it means everything ends up a bit more polished than my own notes I keep to myself. It's also a place for me to refer back to because if I don't write it down, it's very quickly forgotten. If you spot any errors (spelling or otherwise) in anything written across this site, let me know and I'll fix it as soon as possible.

If you'd like to get in touch with me in another way or see how I've been getting on with personal projects, you can find me on:
