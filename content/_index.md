Here you can find my writing on mainframes, general tech, privacy, and cybersecurity - with the ocassional personal thing or two thrown in here and there.

As I spend most of my day job doing cloud and mainframe things, naturally they're going to most likely be written about a lot. With that said, the usual disclaimer: all opinions are entirely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.

I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I don't want to spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here because you liked it/found it useful and want to discuss it further (or simply to send me hate mail), send an email to <blog@fitz.dk>. Each post has a "Reply via email" button at the bottom so it's as easy as possible.

This site doesn't contain any JavaScript, tracking pixels, sign-up forms, or newsletter links. I'm not looking to build an audience, or see who that audience might be. **The main goal of this site is to force myself to write/learn in public** because then it means everything ends up a bit more polished than my own notes I keep to myself. It's also a place for me to refer back to for myself - because if I don't write anything down, it's very quickly forgotten!

If you spot any errors (spelling or otherwise) in anything written across this site, please do get in touch and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
