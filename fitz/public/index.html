  <p>Here you can find my writing on tech, privacy, and cybersecurity - with the ocassional personal thing or two thrown in here and there.</p>
<p>As I spend most of my day job doing cloud and mainframe things, naturally they&rsquo;re going to most likely be written about a lot. With that said, the usual disclaimer: all opinions are entirely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.</p>
<p>I have no plans to allow comments on posts because I don&rsquo;t want to spend time moderating them. If you want to get in touch with me about anything written here - whether it&rsquo;s to tell me you liked it and want to discuss it further, have a question, or because you want to argue with me and tell me I&rsquo;m wrong, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:blog@fitz.dk">blog@fitz.dk</a></p>
<p>This site doesn&rsquo;t contain any JavaScript, tracking pixels, analytics, sign-up forms, or newsletter links, as I&rsquo;m not looking to build an audience, or see who that audience might be. <strong>The main goal of this site is to force myself to write/learn in public</strong> because then it means everything ends up a bit more polished than my own notes I keep to myself.</p>
<p>If you spot any errors (spelling or otherwise) in anything written across this site, please do get in touch and I&rsquo;ll fix it as soon as possible.</p>
